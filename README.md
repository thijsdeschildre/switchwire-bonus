This is a user-driven repository for the Voron Switchwire. This repository collects useful tips and tricks to build and configure a VSW.

## intro
Three paths to build a switchwire
* Self-source all parts, more expensive but allows full control of the quality and configuration
* Buy a kit. LDO kits are good, don't buy cheaper kits
* Convert an Ender. I don't cover this topic, go to the Voron Discord, open the #voron_switchwire_questions channel, on the top right menu click the "threads" icon. There you can click your way to #ender_conversion_chat

## sourcing parts
Voron information to source [here](https://docs.vorondesign.com/sourcing.html) 
There is the [BOM](https://vorondesign.com/voron_switchwire), but you mostly want to rely on the [Sourcing Guide](https://vorondesign.com/sourcing_guide) 
My remarks [here](https://github.com/thijsdeschildre/switchwire-bonus/blob/main/BOM)
