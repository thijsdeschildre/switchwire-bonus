design remarks
the afterburner: the part cooling fan has the cable running in a weird way. you're bound to crack the strain relief on the fan, so the wires start pulling directly on the solder contacts, causing failure
attaching the XZ belts is a nightmare. because of the weird location, it's very hard to reach, and very hard to have any visibility of what you're doing. in the end I have to insert my belts with tweezers
on top of that, there's only one fastener to tighten both belts down. you need to tighten both belts at the same time, while you're tightening the fastener to clamp the belts. you can insert one belt, but you need to hold it tight when inserting and tightening the other belt. if you pull on one belt, the other belt gets pulled out
this is nightmare acrobatics.
can't figure out what distance between omron probe and nozzle (2mm), not described in AB or VSW manual
