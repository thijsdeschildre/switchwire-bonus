If you want to use the Klicky mod, the [Unklicky](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky) mod is recommended. The BOM Switchwire doesn't have a rigid bed structure and it runs on only one rail. This makes Unklicky the most suitable because it needs the lowest actuation force (and has the least risk to deflect the bed when actuating). Especially the [BFP-HS variant](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/tree/main/Unklicky_Probes/BFP-HS) is recommended.  
These limitations of the bed make the BOM VSW unsuitable for Voron Tap as well.  

You will also need the [dock, mounting arm and spacer ]([https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe/tree/main/Probes/KlickyNG/STL](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe/tree/main/Printers/Voron/Switchwire)), the servo arm
