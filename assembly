HW assembly  manual
toolhead PCB is not explained, is this optional?
number of cable chain links are different comparing STEP and sourcing guide ( the CAD has 18 links for the Z, while you need 26. 16 for the X (need 18), 17 for the Y (need 15))
need 2 extra end pieces for the cable chain (2x 1meter, need 3 chains) -> 3D print this
cable chains have 2 different endings?! easy to miss
JST connectors stepper motors accounted for?
need extra 2-pin JST connectors on SKR mini (part fan, x endstop, Y endstop,  inductive probe, thermistor, hotend/controller fan)
3pin JST not used?
hard to visualize afterburner wiring + cable routing + cable length, can't find any good example photos
no info on assembling Mosquito hotend

page 99 of assembly manual mentions a bracket for mounting Wago 221 clamps, but I can't find the STL easily
https://github.com/boingomw/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods
-> has no SW part
https://github.com/MotorDynamicsLab/LDOVoronSW/blob/main/STLs/wago_221-413_3x3_vertical_mount.stl

the HW assembly manual omits the step where you insert fuses into the electric outlet connector... 
I'm using separate inlet + switch, the recommended part doesnt come with fuses installed
assembly manual recomends 14AWG between controller board and PSU, sourcing guide only recommends 16AWG
-> spade terminal is 18-22AWG
-> 14-16AWG spade terminal is Molex, 0191980025

chassis fan goes to fan0 or fan2 on SKR mini v3 ?

inductive probe wiring not explained (only black wire with diode described)
one page still has sample text

the sourcing guide lists EXACT lengths for belts required. you need to mention to leave some excess length on every belt.
also, you need to mention you can tuck away the XZ belts by folding them over. DONT cut the belts flush once you're done tightening them. if you do that, it's a nightmare to ever tighten the belts again, because there's no excess belt to hold on to.
