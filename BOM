When checking the [sourcing guide](https://vorondesign.com/sourcing_guide), make sure you also check the toolhead (Stealthburner) parts. These are not (or not entirely) included in the VSW BOM.  

### wiring
There are specific requirements for the wiring because of the cable chains. You want wiring with PTFE mantles for the best quality and durability.
On Aliexpress you can find PTFE wiring for a reasonable price. You want wiring with a high strand count (for flexibility), and often 22AWG instead of 24AWG.  
Silicone wiring was recommended before, but isn't as durable. Any cabling that doesn't go through a cable chain has no specific requirements.  
  
Recommended wire lengths: a typical build has 140-160cm of wiring between the driver board and toolhead. I recommend to get 2-5meter of extra cable.  
Toolhead 22-24AWG: 4 wires for the fans, 4 for the extruder motor, 2 for thermistor, 3 for Z-probe, 2 for endstop.  
Toolhead 20AWG: 2 wires for heater.  
Heatbed: 16AWG, 2 wires for bed heater.  
Heatbed: 22-24AWG: 2 wires for endstop, 2 wires for thermistor.  

heatbed ring terminals not in BOM ( the assembly manual says to use ring terminals. its more reliable too, AFAIK)

BOM says "Keystone CAT6 Insert" but its not in the sourcing guide
SKR mini needs LCD adapter, not in BOM or sourcing guide (the assembly manual mentions it, and you need it for the recommended driver board (skr mini V2/V3))
maybe put thread locking fluid in BOM

for crimping quick disconnect terminals on the power connectors: TE 2-520184-2  isn't compatible with generic crimp tools, it requires a unique crimp tool from TE, which costs >250 euro
the correct crimp to recommend is 640903-1 for 18-22AWG and 640905-1 for 14-16AWG
