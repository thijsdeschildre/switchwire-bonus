please sort fasteners by diameter and length
ribbon cable mentioned in sourcing guide, but not documented ("Since Lian has 4-6 conductor ribbon cable in a few difference sizes")
a few broken links in the spreadsheet
M3x12 FHCS  in spreadsheet -> is SS ?

recommend PTFE wiring
recommend wire lengths

heatbed ring terminals not in BOM ( the assembly manual says to use ring terminals. its more reliable too, AFAIK)

BOM says "Keystone CAT6 Insert" but its not in the sourcing guide
SKR mini needs LCD adapter, not in BOM or sourcing guide (the assembly manual mentions it, and you need it for the recommended driver board (skr mini V2/V3))
maybe put thread locking fluid in BOM

for crimping quick disconnect terminals on the power connectors: TE 2-520184-2  isn't compatible with generic crimp tools, it requires a unique crimp tool from TE, which costs >250 euro
the correct crimp to recommend is 640903-1 for 18-22AWG and 640905-1 for 14-16AWG
