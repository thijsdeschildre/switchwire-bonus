The number of cable chain links are different comparing STEP and sourcing guide ( the CAD has 18 links for the Z, while you need 26. 16 for the X (need 18), 17 for the Y (need 15)) ? Not sure.  
The cable chains have 2 different endings, this is easy to miss. Make sure you orient the cable chains correctly, otherwise they flex differently.

Page 99 of the assembly manual mentions a bracket for mounting Wago 221 clamps, see [the STL page](https://github.com/thijsdeschildre/switchwire-bonus/blob/main/STL.md)

The HW assembly manual omits the step where you insert fuses into the electric outlet connector...  
When using separate inlet + switch, the recommended part doesnt come with fuses installed.  

The chassis fan goes to fan0 on SKR mini v3. Use fan2 for the chassis fan.

The sourcing guide lists EXACT lengths for belts required. You need to leave some excess length on every belt, otherwise assembly becomes very difficult.
The XZ belts need to be exactly the same length. Use a paint marker (like a Posca pen) to mark the belts at the same lengths, this will help you line them up during assembly.  


You can tuck away the XZ belts by folding them over.
